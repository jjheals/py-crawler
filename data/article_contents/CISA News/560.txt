WASHINGTON – Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) announced the appointments of Jeff Greene as Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity and Trent Frazier as Assistant Director for Stakeholder Engagement. Both served in acting capacities prior to being formally appointed to their roles.“I’m thrilled to welcome Jeff to Team CISA to lead our cybersecurity division and to elevate Trent as the leader of our stakeholder engagement efforts,” said CISADirector Jen Easterly. “Both Jeff and Trent bring a wealth of expertise and experience to these critical roles, and I’m grateful for their willingness to continue to serve our nation. As America’s Cyber Defense Agency and the National Coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience, CISA’s efforts to reduce risk to the nation have never been more important, and I’m proud of our ability to continue to attract top talent to lead our teams.”Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity Jeff Greene previously served as Senior Director at the Aspen Institute, where he led the global cybersecurity policy program. Prior to Aspen, he was the Chief for Cyber Response & Policy in the National Security Council at the White House.“CISA’s mission is more important than ever, and the Cybersecurity Division’s work to improve the cybersecurity of our nation – both what the public sees and what goes on behind the scenes – would not be possible without the dedicated and talented people who make up the Division. I’m honored to be part of this team,” said Executive Assistant Director Jeff Greene.Assistant Director for Stakeholder Engagement Trent Frazier was previously Deputy Assistant Director for Stakeholder Engagement. Prior to joining CISA, he served in a variety of leadership roles throughout the Department of Homeland Security, focusing on protecting and building resiliency within the higher education community, developing cross-border transportation infrastructure workforce acquisition, and program management. “I am excited to assume the role of Assistant Director, and to continue the exceptional progress the Stakeholder Engagement Division has made in advancing CISA’s strategic collaboration across both government and industry over the past several years,” said Assistant Director Trent Frazier. “I look forward to our next evolution, further solidifying meaningful engagement as a cornerstone to CISA’s success.”
