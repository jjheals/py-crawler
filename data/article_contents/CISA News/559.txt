Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience 












WASHINGTON - Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director Jen Easterly issued the following statement today on changes to CISA leadership: It has been an honor to serve with Brandon Wales over the past three years. Brandon has guided CISA through some of the most serious threats facing our Nation. From Sunburst to the ransomware attack on Colonial pipeline to the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Agency and the Department have looked to Brandon time and again for his leadership and deep expertise. With more than 20 years of federal service, including more than 19 at the Department, he was here before we were CISA and expertly helped shape the Agency into what we are today. While we’re going to miss Brandon greatly, we’ve been planning for his departure together and are prepared to execute a seamless transition. Bridget Bean will take over as Executive Director in August, transitioning from her current role as Assistant Director for Integrated Operations. With more than three decades of federal government service, Bridget brings extraordinary leadership and experience to the role, which will involve a dedicated focus on operationalizing a fully unified and cohesive team. We thank Brandon for all he has done for CISA and the Nation and thank Bridget for stepping into this critical role.###About CISA As the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.Visit CISA.gov for more information and follow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram.
