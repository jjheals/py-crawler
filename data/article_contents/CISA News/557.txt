WASHINGTON – Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) announced its first CISA Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer, Lisa Einstein. This selection reflects CISA’s commitment to responsibly use AI to advance its cyber defense mission and to support critical infrastructure owners and operators across the United States in the safe and secure development and adoption of AI. Einstein has led CISA’s AI efforts since 2023 as CISA’s Senior Advisor for AI. Since 2022, Einstein also served as the Executive Director of the CISA Cybersecurity Advisory Committee.“I am proud of how our team at CISA has come together in the last two years to understand and respond to rapid advancements in AI—many of which have significant implications for our core missions of cyber defense and critical infrastructure security,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “Lisa Einstein has been central to that effort. Beyond her technical expertise, she’s an inspirational leader who has brought together colleagues across the agency around a clear and impactful vision. I could not be more thrilled to have her take on this important new role, which will help us continue to build AI expertise into the fabric of our agency and ensure we are equipped to effectively leverage the power of AI well into the future.”Strong cybersecurity is foundational to trustworthy AI, and the responsible use of AI is increasingly relevant for the security of critical infrastructure. CISA has established this new position to institutionalize our ongoing efforts to responsibly govern our own uses of AI and to ensure critical infrastructure partners develop and adopt AI in ways that are safe and secure.“I care deeply about CISA’s mission – if we succeed, the critical systems that Americans rely on every day will become safer, more reliable, and more capable. AI tools could accelerate our progress. But we will only reap their benefits and avoid harms from their misapplication or abuse if we all work together to prioritize safety, security, and trustworthiness in the development and deployment of AI tools,” said Einstein. “It has been a privilege to work with the dedicated and talented CISA team and with our partners across the United States and around the world over the last two years. I am honored to serve in this new role to help CISA tackle this important challenge.”For more on CISA’s work on AI, visit cisa.gov/ai.###About CISA As the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.Visit CISA.gov for more information and follow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram.
