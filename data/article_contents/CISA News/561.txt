WASHINGTON – Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released a companion guide to the Infrastructure Resilience Planning Framework (IRPF), which provides guidance on how local governments and the private sector can work together to plan for the security and resilience of critical infrastructure services in the face of threats. Dubbed the IRPF Playbook, this supplemental manual will assist state, local, tribal, territorial (SLTT) and private sector stakeholders in planning for the security and resilience of infrastructure in their regions.The IRPF Playbook lists inputs, processes, and fictional scenarios like a recipe to help users better understand how best to implement the IRPF guidance. By walking through the IRPF’s core resilience concepts, users can identify their objectives and develop an approach that incorporates the appropriate elements of the IRPF into their planning activities. The Playbook also includes a narrative hypothetical illustration of how a community might conduct resilience planning or incorporate infrastructure resilience into existing planning efforts using the IRPF.“Reading through the Playbook process, not only are the IRPF steps articulated with clear inputs and outputs but the additional guidance on resilience concepts will help communities increase their readiness and bounce back quickly after a disaster,” said Dr. David Mussington, CISA Executive Assistant Director for Infrastructure Security. “We anticipate that the IRPF Playbook will address a crucial challenge by not only outlining the IRPF steps but also providing guidance on their practical implementation in disaster preparedness planning.”The nation’s capacity to secure its infrastructure and sustain essential community services also depends on SLTT and private sector partners working together to assess and reduce risk to increasingly complex natural and human threats. CISA is releasing the IRPF Playbook to share its expertise with the public and with private sector entities, which have the primary responsibility for planning, investing in, and maintaining multiple water, transportation, health, education and other facilities and recovering essential community services.The IRPF Playbook can be accessed alongside other resilience planning resources at the Resilience Planning Program webpage.
