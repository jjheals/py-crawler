Synopsis:
Many do not understand the multiple careers or learning pathways to enter the cybersecurity workforce. The Cybersecurity Career Ambassador Program’s purpose is to promote cybersecurity career awareness, exploration, and development by creating a network of volunteers to serve as champions for expanding and diversifying the nation’s cybersecurity workforce. This project, led by the NICE Promote Career Discovery Working Group, aligns with the NICE Strategic Plan’s Implementation Plan Goal 1 to Promote the Discovery of Cybersecurity Careers and Multiple Pathways. This webinar will provide information regarding the Cybersecurity Career Ambassador opportunity, offer general guidance on the role and expectations, and answer questions.
