The Smart Connected Systems Division of NIST is launching a research project to define technology applications, analyses, key performance indicators, and decision systems for public safety planning to more effectively respond to and recover from large-scale disasters and emergencies. The project will develop an AI-enhanced information sharing and analysis capability to enable collaborative decision-making between civil authorities, emergency managers, and a community’s population., This multi-agency, cross-disciplinary capability will allow communities, cities, and regions to respond to and recover from large-scale disasters and emergencies more effectively and evaluate alternative approaches to managing local risks and potential disaster impacts.NIST will host this Workshop on August 27th and 28that the George H.W. Bush School of Government and Public Policy in Washington DC to explore the concept and preliminary design for a technology application—a cyber-physical-social system—directed at enhancing public safety, health, and community resilience for Smart Cities and Communities.
