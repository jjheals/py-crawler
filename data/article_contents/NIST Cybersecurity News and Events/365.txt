Synopsis: 
The Department of Commerce’s workforce development agenda is guided by a set of best practices and principles that values workforce investments that are employer led to connect skilled workers to quality job opportunities, guided by multiple community partners such as educational institutions and economic development organizations, and lead to stackable, industry-recognized credentials. Cybersecurity workforce needs exist in every sector of the economy; therefore, cross-sector and community-supported partnerships must align with the skill needs of industries in the regional or local economy.  This webinar will explore the foundations for creating multistakeholder, community-based partnerships that can lead to good jobs in cybersecurity.
