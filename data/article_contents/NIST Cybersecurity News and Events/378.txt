Event Information





This second webinar in the Digital Identity Guidelines Webinar Series will focus on the changes NIST has made to the identity proofing guidance and illicit inputs on how the government and industry can collaboratively continue to innovate on identity proofing technology and services. Panelists will explore leading practices in commercial and public sector use cases, discuss emerging trends, identify areas of continued improvement in NIST guidance, and discuss techniques that may provide additional optionality and choice for end users. 
Series Overview
This is part of the Digital Identity Guidelines Webinar Series. In furtherance of NIST’s effort to gain critical input on the Draft Fourth Revision to NIST Special Publication 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines (Draft NIST SP 800-63-4) we will be hosting a three-part webinar series that will explore different aspects of the guidance and seek to gain additional input from the public. Each session will feature a panel of experts weighing on the specific topics, a moderated Slack discussion open to the public, and an extended Q&A session.
