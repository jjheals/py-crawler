More Information





The NIST workshop on Multi-Party Threshold Schemes (MPTS) 2023 will gather diverse public feedback about the process envisioned in the NIST First Call for Multi-Party Threshold Schemes [NISTIR 8214C ipd (2023)]. The process includes an exploration of threshold schemes for diverse cryptographic primitives standardized by NIST, and of other primitives (such as those related to FHE, ZKP and ABE) and assumptions not present in current NIST standards. The success of the envisioned process (collecting reference material, performing public analysis, devising recommendations) hinges on active involvement of the international cryptography community. To that effect, expert stakeholders are encouraged to submit abstracts of short talks (5–15 min) to present at MPTS 2023. Attendance is open to the wider community of stakeholders and people interested in the topic. Live attendance is free but requires registration.
