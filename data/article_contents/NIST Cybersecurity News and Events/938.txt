NIST is actively contributing to the advancement of standards to ensure the security and resilience of emerging Open RAN technologies.













NIST's Wireless Networks Division, in collaboration with the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, hosted an interim meeting of the O-RAN Alliance's Security Working Group April 29 - May 2.  The event brought together over 60  security experts from 4 continents to advance the security and resilience of emerging Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) technologies.   Topics addressed during the meeting included: Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), confidentiality and integrity protection on the Open Fronthaul, System Management, and Orchestration (SMO) security, RAN Intelligent Control (RIC) security, AI/ML security, and security testing for O-RAN.   Hosting the meeting at NIST provided an opportunity to share information on broader NIST efforts in Advanced Communications, Cyber Security, and Artificial Intelligence that intersect with emerging 5G/6G standards.
