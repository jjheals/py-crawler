Doug Montgomery (CTL/Internet Technologies Research Group) participated t in the NSF Workshop on Policy-Relevant Internet Measurement at Georgia Tech University May 21-22.  The invitation-only workshop included leading researchers in Internet measurement, security and privacy, public policy, and economics.   The goal of the workshop was to identify the future research and measurement infrastructure needed to deliver relevant metrics and data to better inform Internet policy.   Topics addressed included the question of how to bridge the gap between the measurement science agenda of the research community and the needs of those who develop and monitor public policy.   A report of the workshop findings and recommended research agenda will be developed.
