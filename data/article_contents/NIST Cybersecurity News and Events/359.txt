CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FUNDING OPPORTUNITY
Today at the annual NICE Conference & Expo, Rodney Petersen, the Director of NICE, announced a new Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). 
Following a successful pilot program in 2016, NIST is again offering funding to establish Regional Alliances and Multistakeholder Partnerships to Stimulate (RAMPS) cybersecurity education and workforce development. As part of the Department of Commerce's Principles for Highly Effective Workforce Investments and Good Jobs Principles, RAMPS will support the NIST-led NICE program. 
Effective partnerships will focus on bringing together employers and educators to develop a skilled workforce to meet industry needs within a local or regional economy. NIST anticipates funding up to eighteen awards of up to $200,000 through cooperative agreements.
Applicants must demonstrate through letters of commitment that at least one of each of the following types of organizations is committed to being part of the proposed regional alliance:
institution of higher education or nonprofit training organization, and
local employer or owner or operator of critical infrastructure.
The deadline to apply is August 7, 2023, by 11:59pm Eastern Time. 
A webinar for interested applicants will be held on June 13, 2023 at 1-2pm Eastern Time to provide general information regarding this funding opportunity, offer general guidance on preparing applications, and answer questions.
