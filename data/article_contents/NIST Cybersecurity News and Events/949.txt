Full Workshop Details


Space is limited so NIST is solicitating potential participants to submit a one-pager describing their level of interest in attending the workshop, their proposed contributions to the discussions, and what they hope to get out of the workshop. Please submit via email to hwsec [at] nist.gov by February 13.





FULL WORKSHOP DETAILSNIST is hosting an in-person all-day workshop on February 27, 2024 to bring together industry, academia, and government to discuss the existing and emerging cybersecurity threats and mitigation techniques for semiconductors throughout their lifecycle spanning the development and manufacturing environments. The purpose of this workshop is to solicit and obtain valuable feedback from the community for informing NIST plan and prioritization on the development of cybersecurity and supply chain standards, guidance, and recommended practices. The topics revolve around cybersecurity measurements and metrics in the form of reference data sets to support the testing, attestation, certification, and verification of the semiconductor and its components and the use of automated cybersecurity tools and techniques throughout the development lifecycle of the semiconductor and components and maintaining the security of the development and manufacturing environments.
