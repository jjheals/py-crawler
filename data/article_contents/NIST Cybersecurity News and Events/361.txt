NIST will hold a virtual workshop on Standards and Performance Metrics for On-Road Automated Vehicles (AV), September 5-8, 2023. Free registration and schedule are available online. The workshop aims to:
Connect the AV community
Provide a holistic update on NIST’s recent work in the area
Serve as a forum for feedback and discussion
Gather information that that will enable NIST to best help stakeholders
This workshop builds from the 2022 NIST workshop; it identified key challenges and opportunities for NIST, which has initiated a NIST-wide Automated Vehicles program to increase capability and help to develop measurement science, standards, and performance metrics for this complex and interdisciplinary field. The 2022 workshop’s output is summarized in NIST IR 8442 Workshop Report: Standards and Performance Metrics for On-Road.
NIST and many stakeholders view these workshops as vital to the future of automated vehicles. On-road AVs are expected to significantly influence key aspects of daily life. Yet, these complex systems can pose safety risks if they do not perform as expected. Thus, industry and government agencies seek to develop new measurement science to characterize performance of these systems in order to help mitigate risks to manufacturers and consumers.
