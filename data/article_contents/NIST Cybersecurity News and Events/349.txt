Between Sept. 18-20, Laurie E. Locascio, director of the Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), will lead a cybersecurity business development mission to Taiwan. As the mission lead, Locascio will serve as the chief and senior-most U.S. representative on the delegation throughout the trip. This mission will introduce 13 U.S. firms to some of Taiwan’s leading information and communication technology (ICT) security and critical infrastructure protection markets.
Department of Commerce business development missions are official international trips where officials and industry representatives travel as a delegation to promote U.S. exports to target economies and grow business partnerships. They are organized by the Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration and industry, economic and commercial experts abroad. The mission is being supported by the American Institute in Taiwan.
