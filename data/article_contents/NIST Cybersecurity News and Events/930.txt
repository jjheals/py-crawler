NIST held a virtual workshop in September 2023 on Standards and Performance Metrics for On-Road Automated Vehicles, attracting over 600 attendees from industry, academia, and government. NIST has now published the workshop report, NIST Internal Report 8527, which provides a short summary of the information presented and stakeholder inputs received. The workshop featured numerous keynote presentations by industry and government leaders on the topic areas of AV perception, AV communications, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, and cross-cutting interactions between the areas (systems interactions). Each topic area included an update on relevant NIST research activities followed by a breakout session to gather information from stakeholders on challenges and future research needs. In addition, on the final day of the workshop, a fireside chat, keynote presentations, and interactive discussion session was held on the topic of digital infrastructure needed to support automated vehicle deployments and safety, including representatives of state Departments of Transportation. This workshop is a key stakeholder engagement component of the multi-laboratory NIST Automated Vehicles Program, which has been supported with internal NIST Strategic and Emerging Research Initiatives (SERI) funding.
