Event Information





This final webinar in the Digital Identity Guidelines Webinar Series will focus on the evolving nature of authentication technology and how organizations and NIST are addressing new innovations in the space. Panelists will discuss phishing-resistant authentication, trends in MFA such as FIDO and Passkeys, and the challenges of moving on from SMS authentication.
Series Overview
This is part of the Digital Identity Guidelines Webinar Series. In furtherance of NIST’s effort to gain critical input on the Draft Fourth Revision to NIST Special Publication 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines (Draft NIST SP 800-63-4) we will be hosting a three-part webinar series that will explore different aspects of the guidance and seek to gain additional input from the public. Each session will feature a panel of experts weighing on the specific topics, a moderated Slack discussion open to the public, and an extended Q&A session.
