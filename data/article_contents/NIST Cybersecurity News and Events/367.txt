In January 2023, the American Council for Technology-Industry Advisory Council conducted its Blockchain Use Case Summit. NIST researcher Michael Pease presented in its panel, “Operationalizing, Blockchain – Manufacturing, Supply Chains, Stablecoins, and Security.”
Pease provided an overview of the published research from NIST Internal Report 8419, Blockchain and Related Technologies to Support Manufacturing Supply Chain Traceability: Needs and Industry Perspectives. Pease also discussed some of the key challenges associated with utilizing blockchains to support supply chain traceability including data security, privacy. Additionally, Pease addressed how these topics are informing current efforts working with the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence on Manufacturing Supply Chain Traceability Using Blockchain-Related Technologies.
