Secure Software: From EO 14028 to Self-Attestation
Based on EO 14028, M-22-18 outlined OMB’s role in the identification of minimum elements from SP 800-218 to which software producers must attest. This panel will address the intent of this effort, the requirements put forward for agencies, and the development of minimum elements to which software producers must attest and submit to agencies. We will also discuss the circumstances and scope of software to which minimum elements apply and when they do not.

Next Steps and Common Questions 
M-22-18 contemplates the use of a self-attestation common form that agencies are encouraged to leverage to satisfy M-22-18 required actions. M-22-18 also speaks to the establishment of a government-wide repository for attestations and artifacts, the utilization of third-party assessor organizations such as FedRAMP, among other items. Speakers will address the expected process for satisfying M-22-18 requirements, the process by which agencies are expected to fulfill M-22-18 requirements, and provide an update on CISA’s self-attestation common form. Speakers will also answer questions received in advance of the workshop in this session.
