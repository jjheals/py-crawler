The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) are pleased to announce the return of the Safeguarding Health Information: Building Assurance through HIPAA Security conference. After a 5-year absence, the conference is returning to Washington D.C. on October 23-24, 2024 at the HHS Headquarters.The conference will explore the current healthcare cybersecurity landscape and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule. This event will highlight the present state of healthcare cybersecurity, and practical strategies, tips and techniques for implementing the HIPAA Security Rule. The Security Rule sets federal standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information by requiring HIPAA covered entities and their business associates to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards.The conference will offer sessions that explore best practices in managing risks to and the technical assurance of electronic health information. Presentations will cover a variety of topics including managing cybersecurity risk and implementing practical cybersecurity solutions, understanding current cybersecurity threats to the healthcare community, cybersecurity considerations for IoT in healthcare environments, updates from federal healthcare agencies, and more.
