In the construction context, integrating 5G networks presents numerous challenges. The NIST Industrial Wireless Team has published an article in the online magazine Automation.com, the flagship publication of the International Society of Automation (ISA), that identifies and addresses the challenges of integrating 5G networks including network performance and wireless communication complexities in the construction industry. The authors explore deploying wireless communication networks within such projects and introduce a comparison approach to assess deployment difficulty at each project phase. A strategic blueprint is provided for a specialized testbed to evaluate 5G network performance in real-world construction conditions. This controlled environment mimics actual construction scenarios. NIST aims to offer valuable insights into the unique challenges of implementing 5G in construction, emphasizing untapped research opportunities. The discussed structured approach evaluates network performance, addressing wireless communication complexities in the industry.  The article is available on the NIST publications website and at Automation.com at https://www.automation.com/en-us/assets/white-papers/white-paper-wireless-deployment-challenges-in-cons.
