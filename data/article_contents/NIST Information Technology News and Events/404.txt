Sign up now for NIST’s free, virtual workshop on Standards and Performance Metrics for On-Road Automated Vehicles (AV), September 5-8, 2023. Registration and schedule are available online.
This workshop brings together the automated vehicle community to provide an update on NIST’s work in the area, provide a forum for feedback, and set a path forward to ensure that NIST’s AV program provides the greatest value to the community. NIST’s work has focused on AV perception, communications, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and system interactions.
Keynote speakers include:
Overall Keynote: Ann Carlson (Chief Counsel, NHTSA)
AI Keynote: Aleksander Madry (Director of the Center for Deployable Machine Learning, MIT)
Communication Keynote: Jim Misener (Global V2X Ecosystem Lead, Qualcomm)
Cybersecurity Keynote: Anuja Sonalkar (CEO and co-founder, STEER)
Infrastructure Keynote: Ed Straub (VP and Director of Automation Office, SAE)
Perception Keynote: Rajeev Thakur (Director, Ouster)
Systems Interaction Keynote: David Agnew (Vice President, DataSpeed)
This is the second in a series of workshops. The first, held in March 2022, drew over 800 attendees. Many stakeholders view these workshops as key to understanding AV measurement and the future of automated vehicles. On-road AVs are expected to significantly influence key aspects of daily life. Yet, these complex systems can pose a safety risk in the event of their unexpected performance. Thus, industry and government agencies seek to characterize performance in order to mitigate risks to manufacturers and consumers.
