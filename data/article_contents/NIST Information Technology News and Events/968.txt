The SAE World Congress Experience (WCX) 2024 was held on April 16–18, 2024 in Detroit, Michigan. The event attracts researchers, government officials, and the engineering community to discuss the mobility industry's biggest challenges, including the deployment of electric vehicles, autonomous vehicle timelines, and global supply chain constraints. Organized by SAE International, this event served as a forum and showplace for the latest technology, consumer metrics, regulatory standards, and technical sessions covering the entire vehicle, from hardware to software, and beyond to their usage in transportation systems as part of Smart Cities. The WCX 2024 keynote speaker, Toyota Research Institute’s Avinash Balachandran, described the ubiquitous role of artificial intelligence (AI) in automotive technology development, from the way vehicles perceive the roadway, to path planning and adaptive manufacturing tooling.NIST CPS and Autonomous Systems researcher Dr. Edward Griffor shared the NIST Strategic and Emerging Research Initiatives (SERI) Automated Vehicle Project’s advances in autonomy modeling and integration of uncertainty into AI-enabled perception. Griffor also discussed NIST progress to date in developing measurement methods for autonomous system task performance, formalizing the work allocation of task performance between an autonomous system and its operating environment in terms of the “fit” of information acquired by the system from its surroundings. Based on these discussions with industry and standards experts, Griffor was able to assess stakeholder interest in and alignment with research directions at NIST.
