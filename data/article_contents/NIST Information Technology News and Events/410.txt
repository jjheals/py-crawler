In June 2023, NIST’s Industrial Wireless System Team, as part of the NIST-led Industrial Wireless Technical Interest Group, held an online workshop on “Deployment Architectures and Technologies for Enhancing the Performance of Industrial Wireless Systems.” Approximately 100 personnel attended. The workshop explored the latest developments that could enhance the performance of wireless systems for critical industrial applications; these included wireless technologies; protocols; and platforms like 5G, 6G, and beyond.
Wireless technologies can help improve operating conditions, performance, and efficiency in emerging smart manufacturing practices and other mission-critical, industrial scenarios. However, deploying wireless technologies for mission-critical industrial applications requires improving communications link performance and reliability in various operating environments to attain efficiency and safety.
The workshop included eleven presenters from government, industry, and academia. They addressed high-performance W-Fi and 5G private networks; open-source initiatives; wireless sensor networks; time-sensitive networking; industrial wireless disruptors; millimeter wave technology advancements; and wireless for safety applications. NIST’s Rick Candell closed out the workshop, describing the P3388 Standard for industrial wireless systems performance assessment.
Information presented will help in several ways. It will enable manufacturers, system integrators, and users to determine suitable wireless technologies for use cases, with expected levels of performance. The information also will help deploy, integrate, and engineer wireless systems. Additionally, it will help enhance wireless performance in challenging environments, with physical obstructions and sources of interference.
NIST thanks the following, in order of appearance, for their contributions: Kang Lee (NIST); Nada Golmie (NIST); Dave Cavalcanti (Intel); Claude Seyrat (Firecell); Ingrid Moerman (Ghent University); Matt Simons (NIST); Pablo Sanz-Fontaneda (IKERLAN); Ted Schnaare (Emerson Automation Solutions); Mahin Atiq (Silicon Austria Labs); Scott McNeil (GPA); Mohamed Kashef (Hany) (NIST); and Richard Candell (NIST).
