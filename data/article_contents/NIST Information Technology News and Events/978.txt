Join Us for the 2024 TLP COI Meeting and WorkshopThe Technical Language Processing Community of Interest (TLP COI) in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cordially invites you to participate in the upcoming 2024 TLP COI Meeting and Workshop. This virtual event, spanning two days, aims to foster connections and exchange insights across all facets of the TLP Community: from researchers and developers to practitioners and consumers of TLP.Event FocusIn an ever-evolving landscape where industry, artificial intelligence, and human-centered intelligent automation intersect with communications and language, it's crucial to stay ahead. This year’s meeting will spotlight the current landscape of language processing needs and emerging applications, with a keen focus on risk awareness, accessibility, and longevity.Why Attend?NIST, alongside industry and academic leaders, is proud to host this public forum to explore and learn about the emerging tools that will shape the critical technologies of the future. Our lineup of expert speakers and panelists will delve into a diverse array of topics, covering everything from current tools and best practices in utilizing and creating TLP systems to real-world TLP needs and use cases from industry, government, and academic research.Key HighlightsInsights into current tools and best practices in TLP systemsExploration of emerging applications and use casesRoundtable discussion with expert panelists on measuring impacts and results of TLP use in the fieldJoin Us!!Don't miss out on this opportunity to engage with fellow stakeholders and contribute to the advancement of language processing technologies. Register now to reserve your place at the forefront of TLP innovation.Topics of Interest:Introductory TLPWhat is TLP? How is TLP “practice” different from that of Natural Language Processing? How do they overlap?Current TLP LandscapeWhat is the “State of the Practice” / Best practices in TLP?Risk Awareness Around TLPHow does risk management play a part  in development and applications of TLP?Data Sharing and Resources for TLP What’s currently available? How can we better share data e.g. in a privacy-aware way?Needs, Gaps, and Applications of TLPWhat are current applications and imminent needs for TLP in government, standards, and industry?Metrics and Measurement of TLP How do we quantify impact? How do we qualify results?Special Topics:Exploring LLMs What are possible industrial and technical applications of LLMs? What are some implications of Pre-trained models vs “Model Adaptation“?Humans as observers How do we better close the loop between operators and monitoring systemsSOP or International Standards mining and supportHow can we accelerate model creation and validation from prescriptive and descriptive documentation?
