WASHINGTON — Today, President Joseph R. Biden signed an Executive Order (EO) to build U.S. capacity to evaluate and mitigate the risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to ensure safety, security, and trust, while promoting an innovative, competitive AI ecosystem that supports workers and protects consumers. The U.S. Department of Commerce will play a key role in implementing the EO, combining sophisticated standards and evaluation capabilities with a robust combination of reporting requirements and voluntary measures. Specifically, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) will be responsible for carrying out a significant portion of the EO’s objectives.

“Expanding on our wide-ranging efforts in AI, NIST will work with private and public stakeholders to carry out its responsibilities under the executive order. We are committed to developing meaningful evaluation guidelines, testing environments, and information resources to help organizations develop, deploy, and use AI technologies that are safe and secure, and that enhance AI trustworthiness.” — Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and NIST Director Laurie Locascio

NIST's Responsibilities Under Executive Order 14110 On Safe, Secure and Trustworthy AI



  The President’s Executive Order (EO) on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence issued on October 30, 2023, charges multiple agencies – including NIST – with producing guidelines and taking other actions to advance the safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The EO directs NIST to develop guidelines and best practices to promote consensus industry standards that help ensure the development and deployment of safe, secure, and trustworthy AI systems. This video discusses NIST's responsibilities under the Executive Order and our plans for fulfilling each of the actions which we are assigned.Visit NIST's website to learn more.
