Technical standards for digital twin capabilities in the semiconductor and microelectronics industry will be the subject of a December workshop sponsored by the CHIPS Research and Development Office. The workshop will be a hybrid in-person and virtual event from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time December 14, 2023, and 8:30 am to 12:30 pm December 15, 2023.  
The event will focus on the potential for digital twin applications—including modeling, simulation, and co-simulation—to support reliable, resilient and high-quality manufacturing processes and enable trusted supply chains.
Technical experts from industry, academia, standards setting organizations, and industry alliances, both domestic and abroad, are encouraged to participate and contribute to identifying community priorities for specific standards efforts. Factors to be considered in identifying digital twin standards priorities include potential for broad impact, feasibility for accelerated development, and suitability for various standards development channels, including through alliances, incubators and accelerators, and standards setting organizations.
This one and one-half day hybrid event provides an opportunity to network and exchange ideas with thought leaders across the sector. The morning of Day One features plenary and panel sessions with exemplary keynote and guest speakers. Breakout sessions the afternoon of Day One and the morning of Day Two provide an opportunity for participants to collaborate and discuss key topics that will shape future digital twin standards activities. Key findings will be published in a post-workshop report and will inform standards planning efforts across the semiconductor innovation ecosystem and within the CHIPS R&D Office.
We encourage interested stakeholders, industry representatives, and standards setting organizations to participate actively in this pivotal event. We also invite international attendees, as fostering global collaboration and enriching the discussions on advancing semiconductor standards and innovation is paramount to success. Join us at the CHIPS R&D Digital Twin Technical Standards Workshop as we collaboratively shape the future of semiconductor and microelectronics standards, foster innovation, and advance the industry as a whole. Finally, we note that a related workshop focused on chiplet interface technical standards will be held Dec. 12-13 at the same site. Information regarding this related workshop (separate registration required) can be found on the chips.gov website for those who may want to attend both events.
