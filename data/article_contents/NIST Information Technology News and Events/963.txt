NIST Internet of Things (IoT) Research Lead Dr. Edward Griffor co-organized, with the Dean of the Medical University of Gdansk, the technical program of the first annual Workshop on “Advancing Healthcare Through Innovative Technologies” held on 24-28 May 2024 at the Gdansk University School of Medicine in Gdansk, Poland. This workshop brought together experts from multiple fields to explore the potential contributions of their domains to healthcare innovation. The purpose of this event was to create an international forum to foster collaboration between these disciplines to stimulate and accelerate trustworthy, high-impact healthcare innovation. Highlights included the use of IoT technologies to support “3D Printing and Scaffolding” for Tissue Reconstruction and AI Analytics for Remote Chronic Patient Monitoring. Dr. Griffor also contributed two presentations at this event, “Introduction to Cyber-Physical Systems and the Internet of Things” and “Some Challenges of 3D Printing Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices.”Attendees included experts in Healthcare Practice, Medical Science, Biochemistry and Bioengineering, Mathematical and Quantum Science, AI and Data Analytics, Additive Manufacturing, and Business and Finance. Topics included Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Clinical Data Processing and Privacy, Bioprinting, AI Trustworthiness and Cancer Research, IoT Wearables for Non-invasive Patient Monitoring, Local Data and Global Public Health, Cardiology and Heart Disease, EMS, and Integration of AI into Surgical Practices and Quantum Computing in Biomedical Sciences. Attendees participated in lab tours on the last day of the meeting, including a review of Mass Spectroscopy practices in Biochemistry and Medicine.
