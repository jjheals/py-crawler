NIST researchers Eugene Song and Kang Lee chaired and led the development of the IEEE 1451.0TM-2024 Standard for a Smart Transducer Interface for Sensors and Actuators - Common Functions, Communication Protocols, and Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) Formats. A smart transducer is a smart sensor and/or actuator. The IEEE Standards Association published the 400-page 1451.0-2024 standard specification on June 26, 2024. This standard defines common functions of Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network components, network services, transducer services, and TEDS formats to help sensor networks achieve interoperability in network and transducer interfaces for about a dozen members of the IEEE 1451 family of standards. These network and transducer services are specified in structured message formats to simplify and standardize the communications of smart sensor and actuator, and device meta data and information. This standard also defines the universal unique identification (UUID), security framework, and time synchronization framework for IEEE 1451.0-based IoT sensor networks. IoT sensor network components (e.g., smart sensors and/or actuators, controllers, and devices) equipped with UUID, TEDS, and standardized interfaces and communication protocols can thus attain plug-and-play interoperability at the network and sensor interfaces, making IoT sensor network installation, maintenance, and upgrades easier and reducing the total life-cycle costs of sensor network systems.Stakeholders of this standard include vendors, manufacturers, system integrators, and users of smart sensors and actuators, and controllers for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), IoT, and Industrial IoT (IIoT) applications, such as smart cities, smart grids, smart manufacturing, and smart transportation.
