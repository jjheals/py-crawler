The Week in Ransomware - December 29th 2023 - LockBit targets hospitals

It's been a quiet week, with even threat actors appearing to take some time off for the holidays. We did not see much research released on ransomware this week, with most of the news focusing on new attacks and LockBit affiliates increasingly targeting hospitals.
These attacks include ones against Yakult Australia and the Ohio Lottery by the new DragonForce ransomware operation.
The most concerning news is that LockBit affiliates increasingly target hospitals in attacks, even though the ransomware operation says it's against the rules.
In December 2022, one week before Christmas, a LockBit affiliate attacked the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto, causing diagnostic and treatment delays. The ransomware operation said this was against the rules and issued a free decryptor.

However, this week, we learned that LockBit attacked three hospitals in Germany, disrupting emergency room services.
We also learned about two New York hospitals seeking a court order to have Boston cloud storage company Wasabi Technologies return stolen data stored on one of its servers by the LockBit ransomware gang.
According to a court order, the Carthage Area Hospital and Claxton-Hepburn Medical Center were attacked in September, with the LockBit affiliate renting cloud storage at Wasabi to store stolen data.
The two hospitals now request that the courts force Wasabi to provide and delete the data from their servers. The court documents indicate that Wasabi is already working with the FBI and has shared a copy of the stolen data with them.
Finally, Microsoft once again disabled the MSIX ms-appinstaller protocol handler after deactivating it in February 2022 and then enabling it again in 2023 for some unknown reason.
However, as malware campaigns continue to abuse this feature, which could lead to ransomware attacks, the feature has again been disabled.
Contributors and those who provided new ransomware information and stories this week include: @malwrhunterteam, @serghei, @demonslay335, @BleepinComputer, @Ionut_Ilascu, @Seifreed, @fwosar, @LawrenceAbrams, @billtoulas, @MsftSecIntel, @DarkWebInformer, @BrettCallow, @pcrisk, and @Fortinet.
