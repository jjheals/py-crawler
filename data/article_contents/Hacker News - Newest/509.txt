 Ask HN: Resources and courses for learning UI/UX design
1 point by World_Peace 5 minutes ago  | hide | past | favorite | discuss 

I'm close to graduation and after doing a few SWE internships I've become increasingly interested in learning graphic and UI/UX design in the hopes of a starting a design agency like MetaLab or Designjoy.I was hoping to get some guidance from HN in making this pivot, there are loads of popular design courses out there and I'm not sure how to vet them, especially given the price tag for some of these.If I were to instead pursue a career in design, do these certificates have any real weight in hiring decisions? I'm assuming my portfolio would be most important when interviewing.I'd also appreciate any thoughts from those with experience running an agency, particularly about early client acquisition.
