DNSControl




DNSControl is a system
for maintaining DNS zones.  It has two parts:
a domain specific language (DSL) for describing DNS zones plus
software that processes the DSL and pushes the resulting zones to
DNS providers such as Route53, Cloudflare, and Gandi.  It can send
the same DNS records to multiple providers.  It even generates
the most beautiful BIND zone files ever.  It runs anywhere Go runs (Linux, macOS,
Windows). The provider model is extensible, so more providers can be added.
Currently supported DNS providers:

Akamai Edge DNS
AutoDNS
AWS Route 53
AXFR+DDNS
Azure DNS
Azure Private DNS
BIND
Cloudflare
ClouDNS
deSEC
DigitalOcean
DNS Made Easy
DNSimple
Domainnameshop (Domeneshop)
Exoscale
Gandi
Gcore
Google DNS
Hetzner
HEXONET
hosting.de
Hurricane Electric DNS
INWX
Linode
Loopia
LuaDNS
Microsoft Windows Server DNS Server
Mythic Beasts
Namecheap
Name.com
Netcup
Netlify
NS1
Oracle Cloud
OVH
Packetframe
Porkbun
PowerDNS
RWTH DNS-Admin
SoftLayer
TransIP
Vultr

Currently supported Domain Registrars:

AWS Route 53
CSC Global
DNSOVERHTTPS
easyname
Gandi
HEXONET
hosting.de
Internet.bs
INWX
Namecheap
Name.com
OpenSRS
OVH

At Stack Overflow, we use this system to manage hundreds of domains
and subdomains across multiple registrars and DNS providers.
You can think of it as a DNS compiler.  The configuration files are
written in a DSL that looks a lot like JavaScript.  It is compiled
to an intermediate representation (IR).  Compiler back-ends use the
IR to update your DNS zones on services such as Route53, Cloudflare,
and Gandi, or systems such as BIND.
An Example
dnsconfig.js:
// define our registrar and providers
var REG_NAMECOM = NewRegistrar("name.com");
var r53 = NewDnsProvider("r53")

D("example.com", REG_NAMECOM, DnsProvider(r53),
  A("@", "1.2.3.4"),
  CNAME("www","@"),
  MX("@",5,"mail.myserver.com."),
  A("test", "5.6.7.8")
)
Running dnscontrol preview will talk to the providers (here name.com as registrar and route 53 as the dns host), and determine what changes need to be made.
Running dnscontrol push will make those changes with the provider and my dns records will be correctly updated.
The easiest way to run DNSControl is to use the Docker container:
docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/dns"  ghcr.io/stackexchange/dnscontrol preview

See Getting Started page on documentation site to get started!
Benefits

Less error-prone than editing a BIND zone file.
More reproducible  than clicking buttons on a web portal.
Easily switch between DNS providers:  The DNSControl language is
vendor-agnostic.  If you use it to maintain your DNS zone records,
you can switch between DNS providers easily. In fact, DNSControl
will upload your DNS records to multiple providers, which means you
can test one while switching to another. We've switched providers 3
times in three years and we've never lost a DNS record.
Adopt CI/CD principles to DNS!  At StackOverflow we maintain our
DNSControl configurations in Git and use our CI system to roll out
changes.  Keeping DNS information in a VCS means we have full
history.  Using CI enables us to include unit-tests and
system-tests.  Remember when you forgot to include a "." at the end
of an MX record?  We haven't had that problem since we included a
test to make sure Tom doesn't make that mistake... again.
Adopt PR-based updates.  Allow developers to send updates as PRs,
which you can review before you approve.
Variables save time!  Assign an IP address to a constant and use the
variable name throughout the file. Need to change the IP address
globally? Just change the variable and "recompile."
Macros!  Define your SPF records, MX records, or other repeated data
once and re-use them for all domains.
Control Cloudflare from a single source of truth.  Enable/disable
Cloudflare proxying (the "orange cloud" button) directly from your
DNSControl files.
Keep similar domains in sync with transforms and other features.  If
one domain is supposed to be a filtered version of another, this is
easy to set up.
It is extendable!  All the DNS providers are written as plugins.
Writing new plugins is very easy.

Installation
DNSControl can be installed via packages for macOS, Linux and Windows, or from source code. See the official instructions.
Via GitHub Actions (GHA)
See dnscontrol-action or gacts/install-dnscontrol.
Deprecation warnings (updated 2023-02-18)

32-bit binaries will no longer be distributed after September 10, 2023. There is a proposal to stop shipping 32-bit binaries (packages and containers).  If no objections are raised by Sept 10, 2023, new releases will not include them. See #2461 for details.
Call for new volunteer maintainers for NAMEDOTCOM and SOFTLAYER. These providers have no maintainer. Maintainers respond to PRs and fix bugs in a timely manner, and try to stay on top of protocol changes.
ACME/Let's Encrypt support is frozen and will be removed after December 31, 2022.  The get-certs command (renews certs via Let's Encrypt) has no maintainer. There are other projects that do a better job. If you don't use this feature, please do not start. If you do use this feature, please plan on migrating to something else.  See discussion in issues/1400
get-zones syntax changes in v3.16 Starting in v3.16, the command line arguments for dnscontrol get-zones changes. For backwards compatibility change provider to -. See documentation for details.
