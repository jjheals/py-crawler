 Ask HN: Material for Elementary School Math Club?
1 point by Ozzie_osman 44 minutes ago  | hide | past | favorite | discuss 

I just moved from the US overseas, and enrolled my six year old in school. I was thinking of helping start a Math Club for his school, but was wondering if anyone has pointers for good material / curriculum. Ideally, it's suitable for K-5, and is both fun and educational.
