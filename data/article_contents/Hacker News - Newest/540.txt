Llama Coder

  An open source Claude Artifacts – generate small apps with one prompt. Powered by Llama 3 405B & Together.ai.

Tech stack

Llama 3.1 405B from Meta for the LLM
Together AI for LLM inference
Sandpack for the code sandbox
Next.js app router with Tailwind
Helicone for observability
Plausible for website analytics

Cloning & running

Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/Nutlope/llamacoder
Create a .env file and add your Together AI API key: TOGETHER_API_KEY=
Run npm install and npm run dev to install dependencies and run locally

Future Tasks

 Make it generate more consistent apps by only importing from a component library like shadcn
 Look into a way to export the app or deploy it in a single click
 New route for updateCode that only sends the latest generated code + the modify request
 Save previous versions so people can go back and forth between the generated ones
 Support different kinds of apps/languages & scripts with Python, maybe w/ E2B
 Fix bug where if a user edits the code, then does a change, it doesn't use the edited code
 Apply code diffs directly instead of asking the model to generate the code from scratch
 Add the ability to upload things like a screenshot to it for it to start from that
 Try multiple shot prompting in weaker models or finetuning a smaller model
