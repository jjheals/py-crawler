How to Download and Install Python on macOS

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/LinkedInJobBot.git
cd LinkedInJobBot

pip install -r requirements.txt


Configuration
LinkedIn_AIHawk relies on three main configuration files:
1. secrets.yaml
Contains sensitive information. Never share or commit this file to version control.

email: Your LinkedIn account email
password: Your LinkedIn account password
openai_api_key: Your OpenAI API key for GPT integration

2. config.yaml
Defines your job search parameters and bot behavior.

remote: Set to true to include remote jobs, false to exclude them
experienceLevel: Set desired experience levels to true
jobTypes: Set desired job types to true
date: Choose one time range for job postings
positions: List job titles you're interested in
locations: List locations you want to search in
distance: Set the radius for your job search (in miles)
companyBlacklist: List companies you want to exclude from your search
titleBlacklist: List keywords in job titles you want to avoid

3. plain_text_resume_template.yaml
Contains your resume information in a structured format. Fill it out with your personal details, education, work experience, and skills. This information is used to auto-fill application forms and generate customized resumes.
Optional Resume Feature
LinkedIn_AIHawk offers flexibility in how it handles your resume:


Using a Specific Resume:
If you want to use a specific PDF resume for all applications, run the bot with the --resume option:
python main.py --resume /path/to/your/resume.pdf


Dynamic Resume Generation:
If you don't use the --resume option, the bot will automatically generate a unique resume for each application. This feature uses the information from your plain_text_resume.yaml file and tailors it to each specific job application, potentially increasing your chances of success by customizing your resume for each position.


Usage


Prepare the Data Folder:
Ensure that your data_folder contains the following files:

secrets.yaml
config.yaml
plain_text_resume.yaml
resume.pdf (optional)



Run the Bot:
