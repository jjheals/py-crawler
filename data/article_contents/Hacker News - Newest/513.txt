If so, please see the wiki page on service submissions and complete the PR accordingly.

Kick does not meet our requirements because the platform supports and encourages detestable and vile content and creators, and we as a project do not want ourselves associated with it.

Thankfully you are not blocking Kick from being used. It should be up the users choice to use or not use the platform. You are not endorsing them for putting it on the list of preset streaming platforms but rather you are making it easier for users to select it and apply. Many are moving to Kick. That's a poor reason to not add it. Are you endorsing all the sexual websites included in your list? Or the few internacional ones which have content more vile than the ones that you claim happens on Kick?
I am not against those cam sites but this is a dumb moral crusade.
You will most likely delete this response but, alas.

The exact same statement could be said about other platforms that are supported. It is not the responsibility of the streaming application to make these types of decisions on behalf of the user.
The "association" referenced does not exist. OBS isn't responsible for anything the user does on any platform - the user is. This is clearly stated in Section 11 of the GPL-2.0 license that OBS uses.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.

Are you sure this doesn't have anything to do with OBS being sponsored by YouTube and Twitch?

Thank you for taking a stance against the vile content hosted by Kick.

There's nothing wrong with it. Twitch promotes sexual content/channels to children and this project is perfectly okay with that because it reinforces to young boys that women are worth nothing more than what they charge for their OF subscription and to young girls that they can make money really easily by using this lovely free software. If that was actually considered detestable or vile then the project would obviously remove Twitch from the services.json file.  This project empowers women to take their shirts off and stream on Twitch with only a few clicks!

pretty sure there is a difference between sexual content and hateful content connected with gambling (which coincidentally, kick is funded by stake.com, big shock)

Odd that its exactly what i think of the guy who wrote this, Don't forget to read it with a nasal voice and a lot of : "Eeee , eee" stammering.
on another hypocritical note, forget twitch, you should see some of the stuff they have for KIDS on youtube, but that's ok to affiliate with (Eventhough i doubt they are even legal if not predatory) .

You've made 20 commits, your latest one being 3 years ago and simply adding a code of conduct, and the rest of them either being theme changes or merging pull requests from actual contributors like PatTheMav. Why should I take you seriously?

You're saying that a service which promotes video game streaming is against OBS's morals, but a service which promotes softcore pornography is what you want OBS to be associated with?

so you want to associate yourself with the camgirl sites currently present in services.json? you know... lots of human trafficking and exploitation going on in there, ask andrew tate.

Lock it. Lock it now. This is the friendliest message I'm going to send, while I look for ways to get OP banned from Github for gross social misconduct. I imagine that "kick viewer" might be enough to get that account tagged as a nazi, who knows how many communities across however many repositories that person just bothered across all of Github.

SHUT IT DOWN BOY,
the users have violated the github rule of applying common sense and stating facts! (Make sure to ban OP for it, he might use common sense and state facts in other repos)
edit : reported @Fenrirthviti , reason : casting aspersion on an entire community, direct violation ( discrimination )

just to be clear, the above is more explicitly stated the service submission guidelines:

We reserve the right to reject service submissions on any reason, including but not limited to the promotion of illegal activities (e.g. piracy), harmful behaviour (e.g. harassment, hate speech), or other objectionable content.

Kick fails on the point of "promotion of ‚Ä¶ harmful behaviour (e.g. harassment, hate speech)"

since we're citing written documents, I'd be useful if you read Kick's TOS which under paragraph 1.4 states that it's not allowed to stream: "nudity or other sexually suggestive content, hate speech, threats or direct attacks on an individual or group, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another‚Äôs privacy, hateful racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable content".
