The handy explanation of computers you've always subconsciously dreamed of, now a reality.

This is a big topic, where you're either a 1 or a 0. But it dosen't matter as long as you don't cause a stackoverflow.
So, After all these years of unknowingly working with computers, i KNEW that i didn't have good enough understanding of what i was using. So as any sane person, I spent hours and hours just researching on my own to end up with 20 thousand words and the conclusion that CP-YOUs are dumb and made out of sand as a prime material (and that's a fact).
